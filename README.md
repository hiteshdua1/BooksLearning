This is a ninja store of all the important lessons I found in the books i have read (Will be reading)

### Rich Dad Poor Dad
##### Mistakes are opportunities to learn
> School has conditioned us to avoid mistakes -- and punishes students for making them.In the real world, i've learned that mistakes -- if acknowledged and evaluated and used as a tool to make better decisions in the future -- are unvaluable.A little fear can be a healthy thing, but we shouldn't live in a fear of making mistakes. Mistakes are good things, if we find the lesson in every failure.

> For most people, the reason they don;t win financially is because the pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.

> Failure inspires winners. Failures defeats losers.
